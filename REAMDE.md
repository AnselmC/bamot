This is the code for my Master's Thesis at the [Dynamic Vision and Learning Group](https://dvl.in.tum.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Laura Leal-Taixe](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/)
and the advisory of [Dr. Aljosa Osep](https://aljosaosep.github.io) and Nikolaus Demmel.
My thesis is also part of the repository (in the `thesis` directory).
