First and foremost, I would like to thank Aljo\^{s}a for his advice, guidance, and support while writing this thesis.
In particular, his vast expertise in all things concerning multi-object tracking was invaluable.
My gratitude goes towards Niko, whose SLAM proficiency immensely helped when implementing object-level Bundle Adjustment.
Last but not least, I thank my parents for their continuous support during my studies.
